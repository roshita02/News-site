                <p class="read-more-wrap" >KATHMANDU, Sept 19: Nepal is beginning its AFC U-16 Championship 2018 Qualifiers on Wednesday, which is the second international competition the young footballers are playing in less than a month.

                    Earlier, Nepal U-15 team had taken part in the SAFF U-15 Championship which was also held in Nepal on August 18-27 at ANFA Complex Ground. Now the same team is vying for the competition of the continental age-group qualifiers.

                    Nepal had reached the final of SAFF U-15 Championship but failed to lift the trophy on home ground after suffering 2-1 defeat at the hands of India.

                    Nepal is facing rival India once again at home as the two sides are pitted in group D alongside Iraq and Palestine for the AFC U-16 Championship Qualifiers. The tournament will be played at Halchowk Stadium, Kathmandu, from September 20 through 24.

                    Head Coach of the Nepali team Sunil Kumar Shrestha said the target is to qualify for the Asian Championship, defeating tough opponents such as defending champion Iraq and South Asian powerhouse India. </p>

                <p class="card-text">

                    BARCELONA, Sept 18: When Barcelona were to face Getafe at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez on Saturday, it had only one thing on its mind, get the three points on board and extend the lead over Real Madrid to seven points, before the reigning champions faced Real Sociedad the day after.

                    But, the game couldn’t go in its favor early on. Getafe’s Gaku Shibasaki scored a tremendous goal in the 39th minute to take the lead against Barcelona for the first time in the season by any club. It was 1-0 until the hour mark had gone, but substitute Denis Suarez equalized in the 62nd minute to make it 1-1 and Paulinho scored a terrific goal from the assist of Lionel Messi in the 84th to finally take the lead.

                    It was the change of plan what favoured Barcelona in the second half. Denis was brought in just after the beginning of the second period while Paulinho on the 77th minute to try a different approach. Well it worked but the performance was not something to admire of.

                <p class="card-text">KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 18: Nepal has clinched the title of ACC U-19 Eastern Region Cricket Tournament defeating Hong Kong by five wickets on Sunday.

                    By winning the tournament, Nepal has qualified for the ACC U-19 Asia Cup where it will get opportunity to compete against Test playing nations.

                    Asia Cup, slated for November in Malaysia, will feature Test playing nations including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan.

                    In the summit clash played at Kinrara Oval Cricket Ground, Kuala Lumpur, Nepal won the toss and opted for bowling before restricting Hong Kong for 76-10 in 32.1 overs. In reply, Nepal got 79-5 in 14.4 overs.

                    Nepal’s head coach Binod Das said that winning the title was an important achievement, even when the country lacked a proper cricket structure. “We have won such age group tournaments several times in the past. But winning this competition at a time when we don’t have any proper domestic cricket structure is a positive development,” said head coach Das.

                    He also said that his team was now highly motivated to do well in the upcoming Asia Cup after becoming the champion in the regional tournament.</p>

                <p class="card-text">NEW DELHI, Sept 14: India opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan has been released from the team for the first three one-day internationals against Australia to tend to his unwell wife, the country’s cricket board (BCCI) said on Thursday.

                    “Dhawan has requested to be released from the team for the first three ODIs... to attend to his wife, who is unwell,” the BCCI said in a statement.

                    The hosts would not name a replacement for the left-handed batsman, with Ajinkya Rahane and KL Rahul both able to play at the top.

                    Dhawan had also missed the last ODI and the one-off Twenty20 in Sri Lanka to fly home to tend to his sick mother. He scored an unbeaten 132 and 49 in the first two ODIs against Sri Lanka but then managed nine runs in the third and fourth match.

                    Virat Kohli’s India will face Australia in the first ODI in Chennai on Sunday before matches in Kolkata and Indore.</p>
