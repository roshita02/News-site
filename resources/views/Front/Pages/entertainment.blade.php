                <p class="card-text">LOS ANGELES, Sept 12: Actor Angelina Jolie, who made her feature directorial debut with ‘In the Land of Blood and Honey’ in 2011, says she never imagined she could ever direct or write a film.

                    The film, featuring Bosnian actors Zana Marjanovic and Goran Kostic and Croatian actor-director Rade Serbedzija, depicted a love story set against the background of the Bosnian War.

                    The 42-year-old star says though direction was never in her plans, she always wanted to work with artistes from other parts of the world, reported Deadline.

                    "I never thought I could make a movie or write one, it was never part of my plan. For me it wasn't just about becoming a director. I believe our world is stronger for diversity and I love to learn about cultures. It's the greatest way to deeply learn and know each other.</p>
