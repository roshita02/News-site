                <p class="card-text">ITAHARI, Sept 16: Nepali Congress (NC) has boycotted the first municipal assembly held at Itahari Sub-metropolitan City on Saturday.

                    The NC boycotted the assembly saying that the Sub-metropolitan city bypassed the budget, policy and programs for the ongoing fiscal year 2017/18.

                    “We boycotted the municipal assembly after the Sub-metropolitan City overlooked our memorandum we had sent to Mayor and Deputy Mayor of the Sub-metropolitan City,” President of Nepali Congress, Itahari Hemkarna Paudel told Republica Online.

                    “The Sub-metropolitan City organized this program without addressing our demand. It is not acceptable to us.”

                    The NC had submitted a memorandum expressing grievances that Sub-metropolitan City did not earmark the budget more than 4 million.

                    The municipal assembly was inaugurated by CPN-UML chairman KP Sharma Oli. </p>
